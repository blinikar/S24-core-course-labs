# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## 1. Automated Builds
   - Set up automated build pipelines to compile, test, and package the code on every commit.
   - Ensure that the build process is fast and reliable to catch any issues early.

## 2. Code Quality Checks
   - Integrate code quality tools like linters, static code analyzers, and code coverage tools into the CI pipeline.
   - Enforce coding standards and best practices to maintain code quality.

## 3. Automated Testing
   - Implement automated testing at unit level to validate the functionality of the application.
   - Run tests automatically on each build to detect regressions and bugs early.

## 4. Continuous Deployment
   - Automate the deployment process to deliver changes to production quickly and efficiently.
   - Use deployment strategies like blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime and risks.

By following these best practices, teams can ensure a smooth and efficient CI/CD process that leads to faster delivery of high-quality software.
