# Lab 1: Python Web Application

I made a decision to make Flask the main Framework for my app, because of its simplicity, perfomance and popularity

## Practises used

### Testing
I used unittests to ensure that application works in the correct way.

### Separation of Concerns
Flask itself implements an MVC Pattern which separates code and template.

### Coding Standards
I used PEP 8 guidelines for Python code. This makes development of the app easier and enhances code readability. I also used modern development practises for HTML layout.
